## Ant build tool

- Ant was developed by Apache Foundation as an Open source build tool
- Ant was mainly used for Java projects as a build tool
- Ant uses build.xml to capture the project name, the project build instructions
- Ant doesn't haven't dependency management support
- Ant has conventions for java project directory structure, hence different project teams follow different folder structure and this leads to confusion
